### Estimation: before looking at the old code:

* How long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?

It will most likely take about an hour to implement this new feature.

* How many files will you need to add or update? Why?

I will need to add one file to contain the feature used to display Turtle view. 
I will also need to alter the menu that is used to select with views are visible 
in the GUI. I will also need to update the class for Turtles to respond to the 
clicking of a image.

### Review: after completing the feature:

* How long did it take you to complete this new feature?

It took me a little over an hour to complete this feature.

* How many files did you need to add or update? Why?

I added two classes to implement this feature and altered a properties file to add
the feature to the GUI menu. 

* Did you get it completely right on the first try?

I did not get this feature right on the first try as I was unsure what methods to call to 
set up listeners with the TurtleManager. The other member of the frontend (Hunter Gregory) for this project 
was able to give me some advice that helped in completing the feature. Prior to implementing the features 
in our own branches, we had discussed a high-level overview of how we could accomplish this new functionality.

### Analysis: what do you feel this exercise reveals about your project's design and documentation?

* Was it as good (or bad) as you remembered?

It was slightly worse than what I remember. I personally find the classes in state_manager somewhat confusing to 
use at first since multiple getters may need to be called to get the data required. However, adding a new feature
to the GUI was a simple process.

* What could be improved?

It would be much more convenient if a single, intuitive getter could be called to get the desired data from the 
state_manager.

* What would it have been like if you were not familiar with the code at all?

It would have been difficult for someone not familiar with the code to set up the listeners
for the turtle image properties. It would have also taken some time to understand the hierarchy 
of the state_manager classes.
