## Before
I'm going to add the view that shows all the turtles' images and allows the user to change a single turtle's image.

I think this will take around 25 minutes to do, mainly because I'll need to think of how to create the JavaFX aspects of the feature.

I don't think what I'm trying to make could subclass the drop down, text window, or slider abstract Feature classes we made, so 
I think I'll only to extend the abstract Feature class. I think all the states I'll need for images and their corresponding turtles are in the State Manager, 
so I'll really only need to make this feature class. 
Then I'll have to include the feature's display name in one of the properties files so that the display can add the feature to its customization screen.
