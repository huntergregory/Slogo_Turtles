# Addition To Slogo

## Estimation
- I believe this will take me around 30 minutes to complete
- I believe I will need to add a file defining that command, and change 3 or 4 files to register that new command and
keep track of the information it requires.

## Review
- This took almost an hour to implement
- I needed to change a couple files in the backend to register the new command
- I did not get it completely right on the first try

## Analysis
- This was as bad as I remembered. I worked on the backend, and the fronted had an extremely limited interface, making
it exceedingly difficult to add this feature.
- The api and communication to the front end could be greatly improved, and allow more flexibility in placement of
turtles.
- If I was not familiar with the code at all, this would have been difficult. I would have had to go searching around
for the various properties files to add a command. However, it was very helpful to be able to see examples of other
commands, so I could copy the technique.
